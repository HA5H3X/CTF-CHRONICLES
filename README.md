# WHAT IS A CTF?
Welcome to the CTF Chronicles Page, where I document my journey through various CTF competitions.


# CHALLENGE TYPES
Jeopardy style CTFs challenges are typically divided into categories. I'll try to briefly cover the common ones.
Cryptography - Typically involves decrypting or encrypting a piece of data
1. Steganography - Tasked with finding information hidden in files or images
2. Binary - Reverse engineering or exploiting a binary file
3. Web - Exploiting web pages to find the flag
4. Pwn - Exploiting a server to find the flag
