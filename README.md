# WHAT IS A CTF?
CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!
# CHALLENGE TYPES
Jeopardy style CTFs challenges are typically divided into categories. I'll try to briefly cover the common ones.
Cryptography - Typically involves decrypting or encrypting a piece of data
1. Steganography - Tasked with finding information hidden in files or images
2. Binary - Reverse engineering or exploiting a binary file
3. Web - Exploiting web pages to find the flag
4. Pwn - Exploiting a server to find the flag
